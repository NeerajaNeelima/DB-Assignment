### 1. Relation Between Product and Product_Category entities : 

Based on the provided context, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship defined by the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This "category_id" column is an integer type, which corresponds to the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This relationship indicates that a product is associated with one product category, while a product category can have multiple products associated with it. In other words, the relationship is one-to-many, with each category having many products, but each product belonging to only one category.


### 2. Product table has a valid category assigned Because : 


To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can implement several strategies:

## Foreign Key Constraint: 

You can define a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column of the "Product" table, which references the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This constraint will enforce referential integrity, ensuring that only valid category IDs are assigned to products. If an attempt is made to insert a product with an invalid category ID, the database will reject the operation.

## Application-level Validation: 

You can also perform validation at the application level, ensuring that before inserting a new product into the "Product" table, the application checks whether the assigned category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table. This approach can be implemented using various programming languages and frameworks, depending on the technology stack used in the application.

## Triggers: 

Another approach is to create database triggers on the "Product" table, which fire before or after insert/update operations. These triggers can validate if the assigned category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table, and if not, prevent the insertion or update from taking place.
